STRATEGY FOR TRANING THE MODEL

For a deployment_failure ➡️ the best action is usually retry_deployment.

For a latency_issue ➡️ the best action is adjust_thresholds.

For a data anomaly ➡️ the only effective action is restore_previous_version.

For a crash_issue ➡️ the best action is retry_deployment.











Crash (deployment_failure)	retry_deployment	✅ Accept
Crash (deployment_failure)	restore_previous_version	✅ Accept
Crash (deployment_failure)	adjust_thresholds	❌ Reject
Slowdown (latency_issue)	adjust_thresholds	✅ Accept
Bad Data (anomaly_issue)	restore_previous_version	✅ Accept
